Track your project using Git( First Time)
  Step 1 decide where you will create the repository. Always create repository in the project folder
  step 2 Navigate the terminal to the right location. to know this, find the location by right clicking on the project name and click on "properties"
  step3 initialize the empty git repo using----> git init
   Step 4 git status using-----> Git status. This will display untracked files ---->red colour
   Step 5 Add all files to the staging area (so that git starts tracking them)------> git add .
   Step 6 Add all the files in the repository-----> git commit -m "enter a message". This command will make copies from staging area to Repo


                Sending our data to github
                
      For every local repo you must create a unique remote repository          
Step 1 create a new remote repository on github(github>>Your repositories>>new>>name it>>make it public)
Step 2 Establish the connection by using command----> git remote add origin URL
Step 3 check that connection has been established------> git remote -v (You should see fetch, push)

Step 4 once connection is there, you must run the command---> git branch -M main
Step 5 to send your codes or data to github----> git push -u origin main (You should see enumerating objects:...done)


             Second time
The second time you will need to push to the same repo if you make changes
git add .
git commit -m ""
git push (Since its a modification you dont need -u origin main)


        Disadvantages of placing repository in Src
1. it will not be able to track any thing else apart
